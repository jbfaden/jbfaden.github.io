This is my github.pages.io experiment.  These are my notes:

```https://github.com/jbfaden/jbfaden.github.io```

is converted to a website with a github action which produces

```https://jbfaden.github.io```

I've also got qdataset.org pointing at this page, but I still need to figure out how I did that.
